#Have an objective way to test the speed of algorithms, 
#Study is called Computational Complexity. 
#Using time as a measurement is limited, too many varaibles to take into account therefore not reliable. 
#Counting number of operations are more reliable. 
#We assume that all basic operations take constant time, 

#The amount of operations and model it as a function T(n)
#Ex T(n) = 5n + 3 

#We can ignore the constants of the function as eventually they will be come negligible. Ex the 3 in the above function. 
#We can justify ignoring all the useless steps, those are the terms without the highest degree. 
#Therefore we only have to look and compute one thing, the one with the highest degree.
